World.ini format specification

General
- Encoding is Windows-1252.

Sections
- Sections are created by wrapping a key in square brackets.
- Example: [Section Key]
- Section keys may contain spaces.
- Section keys are case insensitive.
- The empty section key [] is valid.
- Whitespace surrounding the square brackets is ignored.
- Whitespace inside the square brackets is NOT ignored.
- No characters, except for whitespace, are allowed after the closing bracket.
- If sections are repeated, even if they differ in case, their properties are merged. Properties in later
    sections overwrite take precedence.
- Malformed section headers, such as `[Section` or `[Section Key] abcd` are ignored, causing any properties
    which follow to become part of the previous section

Properties
- Properties consist of a key and a value separated by an equal sign (=)
- Example: Property Key=Property Value
- Both keys and values may contain spaces
- Property keys are case insensitive.
- Property values are generally case insensitive, with obvious exceptions such as level name, signs, etc.
- The KS+ editor recognizes the empty property key. It's unclear whether KS itself does, but it makes no difference.
- Property values may be empty.
- Whitespace surrounding the property key is ignored
- Whitespace surrounding the property value is ignored
- If a property key is repeated, the last value takes precedence

Comments
- Comments are written by starting a line with a semicolon (;).
- Example: ;This is a comment
- The KS+ editor treats lines starting with a hash (#) as comments. It's unclear whether KS itself does, but
    it makes no practical difference (see below).
- Inline comments are not supported.
- Any line which is not a section header, property definition, or comment is completely ignored. Effectively,
    this means comments can be written in any manner one chooses.
